## Prerequisites

Needs following software installed:
1. Some kind of **Unix**-based OS
2. [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build the project
3. [Eigen 3.3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) for using CGAL
4. [SCIP 6.0.2](https://scip.zib.de/) solver for CGAL to work with polygonal surface reconstruction
5. [GLPK 4.35](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) solver, slower alternative mainly used for testing
6. [CGAL 5.0](https://www.cgal.org/) for surface reconstruction
